# SimpleML
A simple Machine Learning Neural Network in Python, using regression. Given a set of 3 numbers, the code attempts to predict a fourth number.

The using loops, the code attempts to find optimal weights to minimize error. The code returns 3 finalized weights (after 10,000 interations of training) and a predicted output number.

Currently, the dataset is extremely simple, but it will  work if the numbers are edited.
